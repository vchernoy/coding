CodeSprint 2: Permutation

Source: http://cs2.interviewstreet.com/recruit/challenges/

This is an approximation solution type problem. Please read about this type of problem at the bottom before attempting.
Given n, print a permutation(p) of (0,1,2...n-1).
From the permutation p, you can create n-1 (x,y) coordinates, where x and y are consecutive pairs in the permutation.
You are also given the n x n square matrix V.
For each coordinate, you can find an associated value in the matrix V. (x and y are 0-indexed)

Task:
Given n and V, find the permutation p that maximizes the sum of the associated values of the consecutive pair coordinates

Constraints:
n <= 50

Input:
First line contains n
Next n lines contains n integers, forming the matrix V

Output:
Space separated permutation of (0,1,2....n-1)

Sample Input:
3
0 4 5
2 0 -2
0 0 0

Sample Output:
1 0 2

Sample Explanation:
Since n = 3, there are 6 possible permutations: [012],[021],[102],[120],[201],[210]
Choose [012]. 
The two consecutive coordinate pairs are: (0,1) and (1,2)
V(0,1) = 4 (again, its a 0-index coordinate)
0 4 5
2 0 -2
0 0 0
V(1,2) = -2
0 4 5
2 0 -2
0 0 0
Thus, the score for [012] = 4 + -2 = 2
By brute forcing each of the 6 permutations, we find that [102] is the maximum with a score of 7, with the consecutive pairs being (1,0) and (0,2), and V(1,0) = 2 and V(0,2) = 5.

Scoring: 
Invalid permutations will not be awarded any points, valid permutations will be awarded points based on the sum of V(i,j) the permutation gets.
