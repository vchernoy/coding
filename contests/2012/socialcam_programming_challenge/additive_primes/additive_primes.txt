A positive integer is called an additive prime number if it is prime and the sum of its digits is also prime.

For example, 83 is prime, and 8 + 3 = 11, which is also prime. Thus, 83 is an additive prime. Note that all single digit primes sum to themselves, and are thus additive primes.

Your task is to calculate elements in the sequence of additive primes.
