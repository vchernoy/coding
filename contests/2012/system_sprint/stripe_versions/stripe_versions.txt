System Sprint: Strip Versions

Source: https://systems.interviewstreet.com/challenges


In a certain version control system (with design similar to Git's), a commit is defined as

  parent: <commit id>
  <payload>

A id of a commit is just the SHA1 of that commit's contents i.e SHA1("parent: <commit id>\n<payload>").

So for example, a perfectly valid commit would be something along

  parent: 7cc08abbdc41b16258454cb815f2241f09b094a1
  some arbitrary payload

A changelog is defined as a sequence of commits, each of which is a parent of some preceding commits.
Write a program which, given an unordered sequence of commits, reorders them to a valid changelog.

An ordering is said to be valid if any commit which is a parent of another commit appears before it.

Taking a simple example.

Say there is a payload "Ax09y" and its SHA1 hash is "01as3", then we can have a commit as

parent: 01as3

Ax09y

The id of this commit will be SHA1("parent: 01as3\nAx09y") say "908ty"

Now let there be another payload "abcd" and a commit with this payload which is parent of previous commit then this commit may be written as

parent: 908ty

abcd

Id of this commit is SHA1("parent: 908ty\nabcd") say "34rt5".

If we have one more commit say with payload "xyz" which is parent of earlier two commits then we can write it as

parent: 34rt5

parent: 908ty

xyz

Id of this commit is SHA1("parent: 34rt5\nparent: 908ty\nxyz").

Input:
A JSON array of the commits

Output:
A JSON array of the commits

Sample input:
["parent: 70d5c5867b4e5f23f2528555539570a06cee7e05\nIIR",
 "parent: e20a83f79618704c87f9922d301b3587e9aed03b\nparent: 3b059cb02ee31cefa2fe32bc2695d70f9c4122fc\noxy",
 "parent: 4142c354781c366af60b52d9e8cab8bc3506b104\nPmS"]

Sample Output:
["parent: e20a83f79618704c87f9922d301b3587e9aed03b\nparent: 3b059cb02ee31cefa2fe32bc2695d70f9c4122fc\noxy",
 "parent: 4142c354781c366af60b52d9e8cab8bc3506b104\nPmS",
 "parent: 70d5c5867b4e5f23f2528555539570a06cee7e05\nIIR"]

Constraints:
Number of commits is not more than 1,00,00(10^4) and size of input file will not exceed 1 MB.
Payloads are strings of length no more than 20.

UPDATE: This is an approximation algorithm problem. Compile and Test option won't work for this problem. Please submit your code to verify.
