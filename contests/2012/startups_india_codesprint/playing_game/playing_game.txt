Source: https://csindia.interviewstreet.com/challenges


Alice and Bob are playing a game. This game starts with two piles of n1 and n2 chips. They play alternatively and Alice starts first.

In his/her turn a person has to remove one of the piles and split the other pile into two piles, these two new piles need not be of same size. The person
who cannot make a move in his turn loses.

Write a program which given n1 and n2 finds the winner. Assume both the players play optimally.

Sample Input:
First line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. Then follows T lines each containing two space separated integers n1 and n2.

Output Format:
For each test case print "Alice" or "Bob" depending on who is the winner.

Sample Input:
1
3 1

Sample Output:
Bob

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 5
1 <= n1,n2 <= 10000
