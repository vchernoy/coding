CodeSprint Startups India: Matrix

Source: https://csindia.interviewstreet.com/challenges

Mr. Evan has given to his students an assignment where they need to multiply two boolean matrices and write the resultant matrix. Boolean matrix
multiplication is done in the same way as standard matrix multiplication except for in the resultant matrix any entry which is not zero is treated as one.

Mr. Evan is tired of checking the correctness of their results, so he has asked you for help.

Given three N X N boolean matrices A, B and C, you need to write a code to determine whether A x B = C.

NOTE: There need not be a deterministic algorithm so you need to come up with a better probabilistic algorithm to get accepted.

Input Format:
First line of input contains the number testcases T. Then there is a blank line. Then for each test case input is in the format: first line contain N ,
then N lines follows each having N space separated boolean values describing matrix A. Then there is a blank line after which N lines follow describing
matrix B and then after a blank line are N lines describing matrix C.

There is a blank line between two consecutive testcases.

Output Format:
For each testcase write in a separate line yes/no depending on whether C equals A x B, x is the sign of boolean multiplication of two matrices. Print
"yes"(quotes are for clarity) if A x B = C else print "no"(quotes are for clarity).
