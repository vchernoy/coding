CodeSprint Startups India: Count Sequences 

Source: https://csindia.interviewstreet.com/challenge

Given a sequence of numbers, a "run" in the sequence is defined to be a maximal contiguous subsequence of strictly increasing or strictly decreasing
numbers in it. For example, given the sequence {1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 1}, the runs in this sequence are {1, 4, 7}, {7, 3}, {3, 6} and {6, 1}.

Given an integer N, you need to count the number of sequences of N numbers having exactly M runs (see definition of run above). Each number of the sequence
should be between 1 and S inclusive. Additionally, no two adjacent numbers in the sequence should be equal and must differ by at most D.

Input:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains four integers N,M,S and D each.

Output:
Output T lines, containing the required answer for the corresponding case. As the answers can be really large, output them modulo 1000000007.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N,S <= 50
1 <= M < N
1 <= D <= S

Sample Input:
3
2 1 3 1
3 2 2 1
4 3 3 2

Sample Output:
4
2
16

Explanation:
For the first case, the sequences are {1,2}, {2,1}, {2,3} and {3,2}.
For the second case, the sequences are {1,2,1} and {2,1,2}.
